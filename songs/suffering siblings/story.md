## Shade's role

Cameron, known as <ins>**C. Shade**</ins> (his gamertag and work name), an average sized guy that hides himself behind a full plastic mask, a big mechanical black fluffy tail, metal claws like [this shit](https://br.pinterest.com/pin/969188782458218433/) on both indicator fingers, dark clothing (like everytime), overcoat + boots like [this](https://br.pinterest.com/pin/476818679315872540/) 

Worked in the Hinobi [Bailley](https://glitchtechs.fandom.com/wiki/Bailley) since the 18s. Paid college with the work and graduated in electronic engineering. Had a small friendship with [Mitch](https://glitchtechs.fandom.com/wiki/Mitch_Williams), that later was broken becouse of the opportunity he had at the main Hinobi headquarters helping containing bugs that broke off protype consoles, also getting a bunch of EXP doing so. 

Got the opportunity to also recieve some new upgrades like his "Debug" glitch tech glove he uses at the right hand as a secondary weapon and [Sergei](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/D5P3B0) ([Wrench's](https://watchdogs.fandom.com/wiki/Wrench_(character)) [Cargo Drone](https://watchdogs.fandom.com/wiki/Cargo_Drone) in [Watch Dogs Legion](https://watchdogs.fandom.com/wiki/Watch_Dogs:_Legion)) as a transport made of [Plixels](https://glitchtechs.fandom.com/wiki/Plixels).

## Pre Song

Its unknown the reason for this (i didnt think)

Shade hacked the HQ and freed the copycat glitch shown in the episode [BUDS](https://glitchtechs.fandom.com/wiki/BUDS), the one who traps and makes clones of people.

The glitch got Mitch, Miko and the whole main cast again.

## the song

After the lockdown, Ridley came to help Five to somehow contain the bug.

The stage would be a corridor, the reception or up there at the store

(BITT serves as the metronome (gf) bouncing with a crying gif like [GIFfany](https://fridaynightfunking.fandom.com/wiki/Friday_Night_Romance_7_(Vs._GIFfany)#GIFfany) in [Cyberhate](https://youtu.be/cXOD3L7QW14?t=1071))

The song progresses normally like the original one.

At the end, Shade shoots the two protagonists, ending the song.
